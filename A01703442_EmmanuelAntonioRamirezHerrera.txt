What made it easier for you to implement the view? W
When I learned how to use String formating made it a lot easier.
Also, XML is too similar to HTML, and I'm familiar with it

hat made it difficult for you to implement the view?
I hate handling intents, that's hard, cus' I don't like that the intents are global and use an adapter for it.
I also had variable problems, because of I can't get a fit with kotlin
